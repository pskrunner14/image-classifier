# Overview ![Under Development](./images/under-development-orange.svg)

Image classification is the task of assigning an input image one label from a fixed set of categories. This is an **Image Classifier** that can used to classify images that contain cats. Image Classification is one of the core problems in *Computer Vision* that, despite its simplicity, has a large variety of practical applications.

I have developed *three* different versions of **Image Classifiers** for the same task in order to gain a deeper understanding of the problem and the backend working of the frameworks and how their performance compares when analysed.
