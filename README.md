# Overview ![Under Development](./datasets/under-development-orange.svg)

Image classification is the task of assigning an input image one label from a fixed set of categories. This is an **Image Classifier** that can be used to classify images that contain cats. Image Classification is one of the core problems in *Computer Vision* that, despite its simplicity, has a large variety of practical applications.

I have developed *three* different versions of **Image Classifiers** for the same task in order to gain a deeper understanding of the problem and the backend working of the frameworks and how their performance compares when analysed.

## Dataset

The [Cat Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/crawford/cat-dataset) from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/) includes over 9,000 cat images. For each image, there are annotations of the head of cat with nine points, two for eyes, one for mouth, and six for ears. We only need the images for this task.
